This code was written to extract underlying data layers beneath Brownian-bridge probability density surfaces, 
and compute weighted mean statistics to analyze space use of animals (in this case wood thrushes and gray catbirds).
Brownian bridges were previously computed using radio telemetry data (Adalsteinsson et al. In review), using methods 
developed by Van Nieuland et al. (2016).
